## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Rate Limiting Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Dashboard showing "Too many requests" error after ~20 page loads

**Solution**:

- Completely disabled rate limiting in development mode
- Added `skip: (req) => process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`
- Increased development limit to 1,000 requests per 15 minutes
- Production limit remains at 100 requests for security

**Impact**: No more rate limit errors during development and testing

### 2. Lead Conversion Validation - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Lead to customer conversion failing with multiple validation errors

**Root Causes**:

1. Data structure mismatch (ISP fields at top level instead of wrapped in `ispData`)
2. Lead update validator requiring all fields even for partial updates

**Solution**:

- Wrapped ISP data in `ispData` object in ConvertLeadModal
- Created separate `validateLeadUpdate` with optional fields
- Updated leads PUT route to use new validator
- Fixed `assignedTo` field handling

**Impact**: Lead conversion now works perfectly, customer created successfully

### 3. React Query Optimization

**Improvements**:

- 5-minute stale time (prevents unnecessary refetches)
- 10-minute cache time (works offline)
- Disabled refetch on mount and window focus
- Sequential dashboard loading (reduces concurrent API calls from 5 to 1-2)
