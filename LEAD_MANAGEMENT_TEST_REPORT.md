## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: API Response Structure Mismatch

**Issue:** `leads.filter is not a function`  
**Cause:** Backend returns `{data: {leads: [], pagination: {}}}`, frontend expected `{data: []}`  
**Fix:** Updated `leadService.getLeads()` to transform response structure  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Bug #2: Duplicate Error Toasts

**Issue:** Error messages displayed twice  
**Cause:** Both API interceptor and modal showing error toasts  
**Fix:** Removed duplicate error handling from modals  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Bug #3: Backend Enum Mismatch

**Issue:** Backend validation rejecting lead creation  
**Cause:** Frontend sending capitalized enums ("New", "Cold Call"), backend expects lowercase ("new", "phone")  
**Fix:** Updated all select options in both modals to use lowercase backend enums  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Bug #4: Missing Required Fields

**Issue:** Backend requiring assignedTo field  
**Cause:** Frontend not sending assignedTo in create/update payloads  
**Fix:** Added user validation and assignedTo field from localStorage  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Bug #5: EditLeadModal Syntax Error

**Issue:** Duplicate object properties in submitData  
**Cause:** Code duplication during refactoring  
**Fix:** Removed duplicate properties, kept single clean object  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
