## üí° Next Action

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Continue implementing** the Edit Modal (45 mins work)?
2. **Test the Create Modal** first to ensure it's working perfectly?
3. **Move to Customer Details Modal** instead?
4. **Create all remaining modals** then test everything together?

**Recommendation**: Let's test the CREATE functionality first to make sure it works, then continue with Edit and Details modals. This way we catch any issues early.
