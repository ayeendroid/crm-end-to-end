# Quick Start Guide - What to Do Next

## ✅ Current Status: Search Working Perfectly!

The customer search now handles all cases correctly:

- ✅ "ken" → Ken Adams
- ✅ "ken " → Ken Adams (trailing space handled)
- ✅ "ken a" → Ken Adams (fullName search working!)
- ✅ "adams" → Ken Adams

---

## 🎯 Next 5 Minutes: Test Email Integration

### Step 1: Open Customer360

```
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/customers
2. Click on any customer name (e.g., "Ken Adams")
3. Customer360 view should open
```

### Step 2: Send Test Email

```
1. Click "Send Email" button
2. Email composer modal opens
3. Email should be pre-filled in "To" field
4. Enter:
   Subject: "Test Email from CRM"
   Body: "This is a test to verify email integration works correctly"
5. Click "Send"
6. Should show success message
```

### Step 3: Verify in MongoDB

```powershell
# In terminal:
cd C:\Users\anmol\Documents\CRM
node scripts\check-emails.js
```

**Look for:**

- `customerId` should be MongoDB ObjectId like `"670f4a5b8c7d2e3a4f5b6c7d"`
- Should NOT be `"1"` (that would be a bug)
- Email should have all fields: to, from, subject, body, status, sentAt

### Step 4: Check Email History

```
1. Still in Customer360 view
2. Click "Email History" tab
3. Should see your test email in the list
4. Verify correct date, subject, and status
```

### ✅ Success Criteria:

- [ ] Email composer opens
- [ ] Email sends successfully
- [ ] Email saved in MongoDB with correct customerId
- [ ] Email appears in Email History tab

### ❌ If Something Fails:

Report the exact error message and I'll fix it immediately!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Testing Search:

- Type slowly: "k" → "ke" → "ken" → "ken " → "ken a"
- Watch results update in real-time
- Try different customer names from your database

### Testing Email:

- Send multiple emails to same customer
- Check they all appear in Email History
- Verify timestamps are correct

### MongoDB Verification:

```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or mongosh:
use bharatnet-crm

// Find a customer
db.customers.findOne({ firstName: "Ken" })
// Copy the _id value

// Find emails for that customer
db.emails.find({ customerId: ObjectId("PASTE_ID_HERE") })
```
