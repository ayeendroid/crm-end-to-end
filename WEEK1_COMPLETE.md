## 💡 Technical Learnings

### React Patterns Mastered

1. **Compound State Management**

   ```typescript
   const [visibleWidgets, setVisibleWidgets] = useState({
     stats: true,
     alerts: true,
     // ... 9 more widgets
   });
   ```

2. **React Query Refetching**

   ```typescript
   const { data, refetch: refetchName } = useQuery({...});
   // Later: refetchName()
   ```

3. **Conditional Rendering Chains**
   ```typescript
   {
     !isLoading && visibleWidgets.key && data && <Component />;
   }
   ```

### Recharts Best Practices

1. Responsive containers with percentage widths
2. Custom gradients in `<defs>`
3. Tooltip customization with `contentStyle`
4. Label formatting with `tickFormatter`
5. Funnel charts with `<LabelList>` and `<Cell>`

### TypeScript Patterns

1. Union types for date ranges: `'7d' | '30d' | '90d' | '1y'`
2. Optional chaining for API responses: `overview?.leads?.total`
3. Type guards for null checks
4. Interface extensions for component props
