# Quick Fix Applied!

## Issue

Vite was caching old code from the Customer modals.

## Solution

1. âœ… Cleared Vite cache (`.vite` folder deleted)
2. âœ… Stopped all Node processes
3. âœ… Restarted dev servers fresh

## New Status

**Servers Running**:

- ðŸŸ¢ Backend: http://localhost:3000 (MongoDB connected)
- ðŸŸ¢ Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Fresh start, clean cache)

**Files Fixed**:

- âœ… CreateCustomerModal.tsx - Using service layer
- âœ… EditCustomerModal.tsx - Using service layer

## Test Now!

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173
2. Login if needed
3. Navigate to Customers
4. Try creating a customer:
   - Click "+ New Customer"
   - Fill: First Name, Last Name, Email
   - Click "Create Customer"
   - **Should work now!** âœ…

## What Changed

The files were correct, but Vite had old compiled code in cache. Fresh restart should resolve this.

**Time**: October 16, 2025 - 12:17 AM
**Status**: Ready for testing with clean cache! ðŸš€
