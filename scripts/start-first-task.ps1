I need to implement virtual scrolling in my CustomerList component using TanStack Virtual.

Current CustomerList component location: client/src/components/Customers/CustomerList.tsx

Requirements:
- Handle 1000+ customers smoothly
- Maintain existing filtering and sorting
- Keep existing TypeScript types
- Smooth scrolling performance
- Proper loading states

Provide:
1. Complete CustomerList component with virtual scrolling
2. TypeScript types
3. Usage example
4. Performance optimization tips

After this, I'll need the same for DealPipeline and LeadList components.
