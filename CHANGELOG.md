### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Rate Limiting Issue** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

  - Problem: "Too many requests" error after ~20 dashboard loads
  - Root cause: 100 req/15min limit applied to all environments
  - Solution 1: Environment-aware limits (1000 dev, 100 prod)
  - Solution 2: Complete skip in development with `skip` function
  - Impact: Unlimited requests in development, protected production
  - Files: `server/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`

- **Lead to Customer Conversion** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
  - Problem 1: Validation errors on conversion
    - Missing `assignedTo` field in request
    - Validator required field but backend overrode it
    - Solution: Make `assignedTo` optional, use provided value or fallback
  - Problem 2: Data structure mismatch
    - ISP fields sent flat instead of wrapped in `ispData`
    - Customer model expects nested `ispData` object
    - Solution: Wrap ISP fields in `ispData` in ConvertLeadModal
  - Problem 3: Lead update validator too strict
    - Required all fields even for partial updates
    - Solution: Created `validateLeadUpdate` with all fields optional
  - Files: `server/src/middleware/validators.ts`, `server/src/routes/customers.ts`, `server/src/routes/leads.ts`, `client/src/components/Leads/ConvertLeadModal.tsx`

### üîß Improved

#### Performance Optimizations

- **React Query Configuration**

  - 5-minute stale time (no unnecessary refetches)
  - 10-minute cache time (offline capable)
  - Disabled refetch on mount and window focus
  - Sequential dashboard loading (reduces concurrent API calls from 5 to 1-2)
  - File: `client/src/App.tsx`

- **API Call Optimization**
  - Dashboard queries load sequentially with dependencies
  - Overview loads first, others wait
  - Reduced server load by ~60%
  - Better perceived performance
