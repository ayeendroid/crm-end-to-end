  revenue: { total, monthly, average }
  metrics: { conversionRate, winRate }
}

export interface TrendData { ... }
export interface LeadPerformance { ... }
export interface DealPipeline { ... }
export interface CustomerInsights { ... }
export interface TeamPerformance { ... }
```

#### 6 Service Functions:

1. **getOverview(startDate?, endDate?)** - Overview with date filtering
2. **getTrends(months = 12)** - Trend data for charts
3. **getLeadPerformance()** - Lead source and conversion metrics
4. **getDealPipeline()** - Pipeline visibility and forecasting
5. **getCustomerInsights()** - Customer segmentation and NPS

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard UI (client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)

**File**: `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (Updated, ~330 lines)

#### Changes Made:

**Added React Query Integration**:

```typescript
const { data: overview, isLoading: overviewLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["analytics-overview", dateRange],
  queryFn: () => analyticsService.getOverview(dateRange.start, dateRange.end),
});

const { data: customerInsights, isLoading: insightsLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["customer-insights"],
  queryFn: () => analyticsService.getCustomerInsights(),
});
```

**Stats Cards - Real Data**:

1. **Monthly Revenue (MRR)** - From `overview.revenue.monthly`
2. **Active Customers** - From `overview.customers.active`
3. **Qualified Leads** - From `overview.leads.qualified` + conversion rate
4. **Won Deals** - From `overview.deals.won` + win rate

**Alerts - Real Data**:

1. High churn risk customers count
2. Average NPS score with satisfaction level
3. Total revenue and average deal size

**Loading States**:

- ✅ Spinner while loading
- ✅ "Loading analytics..." message
- ✅ Smooth transition to data display

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture:

**MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline**:

```javascript
// Example: Revenue trends
Deal.aggregate([
  { $match: { stage: "closed-won", actualCloseDate: { $gte: startDate } } },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        year: { $year: "$actualCloseDate" },
        month: { $month: "$actualCloseDate" },
      },
      revenue: { $sum: "$value" },
    },
  },
  { $sort: { "_id.year": 1, "_id.month": 1 } },
]);
```

**Performance Optimizations**:

- ✅ Parallel queries using `Promise.all()`
- ✅ Indexed fields (createdAt, status, stage, assignedTo)
- ✅ Efficient aggregations with $match before $group
- ✅ Limited data retrieval (top 5 deals only)

**Authentication**:

- ✅ All routes protected with `requireAuth` middleware
- ✅ JWT token validation
- ✅ User context available in requests

---

### Frontend Architecture:

**State Management**:

- ✅ React Query for server state
- ✅ Automatic caching and refetching
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Query key-based invalidation

**Data Flow**:

```
Dashboard Component
  ↓
React Query (useQuery)
  ↓
analyticsService
  ↓
API Request (with auth token)
  ↓
Backend Analytics Routes
  ↓
MongoDB Aggregation
  ↓
Response → Cache → UI Update
```

**Error Handling**:

- ✅ Global API interceptor catches errors
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Loading spinners during API calls
- ✅ Graceful degradation (empty states)

## 📊 Analytics Metrics Explained

### 1. Conversion Rate

**Formula**: `(Converted Leads / Total Leads) × 100`
**Example**: 245 converted leads / 3500 total leads = 7% conversion rate
**Benchmark**: 5-10% is typical for B2B SaaS

### 2. Win Rate

**Formula**: `(Won Deals / Total Deals) × 100`
**Example**: 245 won deals / 420 total deals = 58.3% win rate
**Benchmark**: 20-30% is typical for enterprise sales

### 3. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Formula**: `((Promoters - Detractors) / Total) × 100`
**Ranges**:

- **-100 to 0**: Poor (needs immediate action)
- **0 to 30**: Good (average)
- **30 to 70**: Great (above average)
- **70 to 100**: Excellent (world-class)

### 4. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**Formula**: `Sum of all active customer monthly plan prices`
**Example**: 1100 customers × ₹999/month (avg) = ₹1,098,900 MRR
**Growth**: Track month-over-month % change

### 5. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Formula**: `Average Revenue per Customer × Average Customer Lifespan`
**Example**: ₹999/month × 36 months = ₹35,964 LTV
**Use**: Determine customer acquisition cost (CAC) budget

### 6. Churn Rate

**Formula**: `(Customers Lost / Total Customers at Start) × 100`
**Example**: 23 lost / 1100 customers = 2.1% monthly churn
**Benchmark**: < 5% monthly is healthy for ISPs

## 🧪 Testing the Analytics

### Manual Testing Checklist:

**Dashboard Page**:

- [ ] Navigate to `/` (Dashboard)
- [ ] Verify loading spinner appears initially
- [ ] Check all 4 stat cards display real data
- [ ] Verify Monthly Revenue shows correct MRR
- [ ] Verify Active Customers count matches backend
- [ ] Verify Qualified Leads shows conversion rate
- [ ] Verify Won Deals shows win rate
- [ ] Check alerts section displays churn risk
- [ ] Check NPS score alert shows correct average
- [ ] Check revenue alert shows total and average

**API Endpoints** (Postman/Thunder Client):

```bash
# 1. Overview
GET http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/overview
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# 2. Trends (last 6 months)
GET http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/trends?months=6
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# 3. Lead Performance
GET http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/lead-performance

## 🚀 Next Features (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Date Range Picker

**Implementation**: Add react-datepicker component

```typescript
const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState({ start: null, end: null });
// Pass to getOverview(dateRange.start, dateRange.end)
```

### 2. Charts with Recharts

**Installation**: `npm install recharts`
**Implementation**:

```typescript
import {
  LineChart,
  Line,
  XAxis,
  YAxis,
  CartesianGrid,
  Tooltip,
} from "recharts";

<LineChart data={trends.revenue}>
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="revenue" stroke="#8884d8" />
</LineChart>;
```

### 3. Export to CSV/PDF

**Implementation**: Add export buttons

```typescript
import { CSVLink } from "react-csv";
<CSVLink data={overview} filename="analytics-report.csv">
  Export CSV
</CSVLink>;
```

### 4. Real-time Updates

**Implementation**: WebSocket or polling

```typescript
useQuery({
  queryKey: ["analytics-overview"],
  queryFn: analyticsService.getOverview,
  refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch every 30 seconds
});
```

### 5. Drill-down Views

**Implementation**: Click stat card → detailed page

```typescript
<Link to="/analytics/customers">
  <StatCard data={overview.customers} />
</Link>
```
