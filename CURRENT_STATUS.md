## 🤖 AI Features to Implement

### Phase 1: Basic Intelligence (Can start now with rules)

1. **Churn Prediction**
   - Rule-based initially:
     - High tickets + Low NPS + Payment delays = High Churn Risk
     - Usage < 50% of plan speed = Medium Risk
   - Display alerts on dashboard
   - Recommend retention actions

2. **Plan Recommendations**
   - If usage consistently > 90% → Suggest upgrade
   - If usage consistently < 30% → Suggest downgrade
   - Show potential savings/benefits

3. **Ticket Auto-Categorization**
   - Keywords matching:
     - "slow", "speed" → Slow Speed category
     - "not connecting", "down" → No Internet category
     - "payment", "bill" → Billing category

### Phase 2: ML Integration (After basic features)

1. **Churn Prediction Model**
   - Train on historical data
   - Features: tickets, NPS, usage, payment history, demographics
   - Deploy model API

2. **Lead Scoring Model**
   - Predict conversion probability
   - Features: location, budget, building type, source

3. **Support Ticket Intelligence**
   - Predict resolution time
   - Suggest solutions from knowledge base
   - Auto-assign to best technician
