## 💡 My Recommendation

**Let's test the CREATE and EDIT features right now** (10-15 mins) to ensure they work perfectly. This way:

1. We catch any bugs immediately
2. We verify the full CRUD flow works
3. We can confidently say Phase A is 90% complete
4. We make a data-driven decision on whether to add Details Modal

**After testing, we can:**

- If everything works: Move to Phase C (comprehensive testing) or start Leads Management
- If there are issues: Fix them quickly while the code is fresh
