# 🎉 YOUR CRM IS NOW RUNNING!

## ✅ Current Status

- **Backend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- **MongoDB**: ✅ Connected
- **Rate Limiting**: ✅ DISABLED in development (no more "too many requests" errors!)

---

## 🚀 What I Fixed for You

### 1. Rate Limiting is NOW COMPLETELY DISABLED in Development

The rate limiter will **SKIP** all requests when `NODE_ENV=development`. You can make unlimited requests now!

**Changes Made:**

- `server/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`
  - Added `skip: (req) => process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`
  - This means **NO rate limiting** in development
  - Increased backup limit to 10,000 requests (if skip fails)
  - Auth limiter also disabled in development

### 2. React Query is Optimized

- 5-minute stale time (won't refetch unnecessarily)
- 10-minute cache time (works offline)
- No refetch on mount or window focus

### 3. Dashboard Loads Sequentially

- Overview loads first
- Other charts wait for overview to complete
- Reduces concurrent API calls from 5 to 1-2

## 🐛 If You See Errors

### "Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"

**Cause**: Backend might have crashed
**Fix**:

```powershell
# Check backend terminal - look for errors
# If crashed, restart backend:
cd C:\Users\anmol\Documents\CRM\server
npm run dev
```

### "Too Many Requests" (Should NOT happen now!)

**Cause**: Rate limiter might not be disabled (check NODE_ENV)
**Fix**:

```powershell
# Verify NODE_ENV in server/.env file
# Should say: NODE_ENV=development

# Restart backend after verification
```

### Charts Not Loading

**Cause**: MongoDB data might be empty
**Fix**:

- You need to add some test data first
- Create customers, leads, or deals through the UI
- Or use the API to seed test data

## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep both terminals open** - Don't close the backend or frontend terminals
2. **Watch for errors** - Check both terminals if something doesn't work
3. **MongoDB must be running** - CRM won't work without MongoDB
4. **Clear browser cache** - If UI looks broken, press Ctrl+Shift+R in browser
5. **Check the console** - Press F12 in browser to see errors

---

## 🆘 Emergency Reset

If everything breaks and you want to start fresh:

```powershell
# Stop all Node processes
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Wait 5 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# Start backend
cd C:\Users\anmol\Documents\CRM\server
npm run dev
# (Keep this terminal open!)

# In a NEW terminal, start frontend
cd C:\Users\anmol\Documents\CRM\client
npm run dev
# (Keep this terminal open too!)
```
