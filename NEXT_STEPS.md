## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Email Sending Fails

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server terminal for errors
3. Verify MongoDB is running: `sc query MongoDB`
4. Check email service logs

### Navigation Issues

1. Check browser console
2. Verify URL changes: `/customers/:id`
3. Check network tab for API calls
4. Verify customer ID exists in database

### Data Not Loading

1. Check API response in network tab
2. Verify customer exists: Check MongoDB
3. Check server logs
4. Verify backend is running on port 3000

---

## 💻 Quick Commands

### Check Servers

```powershell
# MongoDB status
sc query MongoDB

# Backend server (should be running on port 3000)
cd server
npm start

# Frontend dev server (should be running on port 5173)
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Check Database

```bash
# View all emails
node scripts/check-emails.js

# Count customers
# (You may want to create this script)
```

### Restart if Needed

```powershell
# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd client
npm run dev

# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd server
npm start
```

## 📊 What to Report

When testing, please note:

### ✅ If it works:

## 🎯 Priority Order

1. **Test Email Sending** (Most important - this was the main issue)
2. **Verify Email History** (Confirms the fix is complete)
3. **Investigate Search** (Separate issue to address)

---

## 📝 Notes

- All Customer360 changes are complete and working
- Email integration is ready - just needs testing
- Search issue is separate and still needs investigation
- No code changes needed for email testing

---

**Ready when you are!** 🚀

Let me know:

1. If email sending works
2. If Email History tab works
3. Details about the search bar issue

Then we can fix any remaining issues!
