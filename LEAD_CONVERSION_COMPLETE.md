## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Calls Sequence:

```javascript
// Step 1: Create customer
POST /api/customers
Body: {
  firstName, lastName, email, phone, company,
  status: "active",
  address: {...},
  plan: { type, speed, price, billingCycle, ottApps, liveChannels },
  usage: { dataConsumed: 0, averageSpeed: 0, uptime: 100 },
  tickets: 0,
  nps_score: 8,
  churnRisk: "Low",
  customerSince: new Date(),
  lifetime_value: price * 12
}

// Step 2: Update lead status
PUT /api/leads/:id
Body: {
  status: "closed-won",
  notes: "Converted to customer on [date]"
}
```

### State Management:

```typescript
const [showConvertModal, setShowConvertModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedLead, setSelectedLead] = useState<Lead | null>(null);
```

### Error Handling:

- Global API interceptor handles all errors
- Toast notifications for success/failure
- Disabled submit button while processing
- Loading spinner during API calls

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Open /leads-new page
- [ ] Create a new lead with status "Qualified"
- [ ] Verify green arrow button appears only for qualified leads
- [ ] Click convert button → modal opens
- [ ] Verify lead data is pre-populated in form
- [ ] Change ISP plan speed → verify price auto-updates
- [ ] Submit form → verify success toast
- [ ] Check lead status changed to "closed-won" in leads table
- [ ] Verify redirect to /customers page
