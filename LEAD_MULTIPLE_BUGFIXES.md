# Lead Management - Multiple Bug Fixes ✅

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Toast Error with Object Rendering

**Error**: `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {message, stack, error})`

**Cause**: Duplicate error handling - API interceptor was already showing errors, but modals were trying to show them again

**Solution**: Removed duplicate `toast.error()` calls from modal catch blocks since `api.ts` interceptor already handles all errors globally

---

### Issue 2: Backend/Frontend Enum Mismatch

**Error**: Lead creation failing due to validation errors

**Cause**: Backend Lead model uses lowercase enum values, but frontend was sending capitalized values:

- Backend: `"new"`, `"contacted"`, `"website"`, `"referral"`
- Frontend: `"New"`, `"Contacted"`, `"Website"`, `"Referral"`

**Solution**: Updated all select option values to match backend enums

---

### Issue 3: Missing Required Field

**Error**: `assignedTo` field required but not provided

**Cause**: Backend Lead model requires `assignedTo` (user ID), but frontend wasn't sending it

**Solution**: Extract current user from localStorage and include in API payload

---
