**Date**: October 16, 2025 - 12:10 AM  
**Project Completion**: 60%  
**Backend Tests**: 54/54 passing (100%)

## 🚨 Latest Update - Customer Module Fixed!

### Problem Reported

> "a lot of things are not working somehow on frontend, saying it is failed, example updating customers. so please check that as well for all modules"

### Investigation Results

**Root Cause Identified**: ✅

- Customer modals (`CreateCustomerModal.tsx` and `EditCustomerModal.tsx`) were using raw `fetch()` calls
- This bypassed the axios interceptors (authentication, error handling, response parsing)
- Inconsistent with Leads and Deals modules which use proper service layer

**Impact**:

- ❌ Customer create operations failing
- ❌ Customer update operations failing
- ❌ Generic error messages instead of specific ones
- ❌ No automatic authentication token injection
- ❌ No standardized error handling

### Solution Applied ✅

**Files Fixed**:

1. ✅ `client/src/components/Customers/CreateCustomerModal.tsx`

   - Added import: `createCustomer` from service layer
   - Removed: Raw fetch() with manual headers
   - Added: Proper service layer call with type safety
   - Added: Missing `source` field
   - Added: Type assertions for enum values

2. ✅ `client/src/components/Customers/EditCustomerModal.tsx`
   - Added import: `updateCustomer` from service layer
   - Removed: Raw fetch() with manual headers
   - Added: Proper service layer call with type safety
   - Added: Type assertions for enum values

**Result**:

- ✅ Consistent with Leads and Deals modules
- ✅ Automatic authentication via axios interceptors
- ✅ Global error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ No compile errors

### Module Status

| Module        | Create     | Update     | Delete     | Service Layer | Status    |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Customers** | ✅ Fixed   | ✅ Fixed   | ✅ Working | ✅ Complete   | **FIXED** |
| **Leads**     | ✅ Working | ✅ Working | ✅ Working | ✅ Complete   | **OK**    |
| **Deals**     | ✅ Working | ✅ Working | ✅ Working | ✅ Complete   | **OK**    |
