### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure ✅

- 100% backend test coverage (24/24 tests passing)
- Enhanced models with ISP-specific fields
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and validation
- 602 records in MongoDB (500 customers, 100 leads, 2 users)

### Phase 2: Authentication Integration ✅

- Login/logout functionality
- JWT token management
- Protected routes
- Auto-redirect logic

### Phase 3: Customer Management Integration ✅

- CustomersNew page with real API
- CREATE/EDIT/DELETE operations
- Search and filtering
- Pagination
- Bug fixes for validation errors

---

## 🎯 Next Priority: Lead Management Integration

### Overview

Connect the Leads page to backend API and implement full lead lifecycle management with ISP-specific features.

### Goals

1. Display real leads from MongoDB
2. CRUD operations for leads
3. Lead status tracking (New → Contacted → Qualified → Converted)
4. Lead conversion to customer
5. Filtering and search
6. Priority-based sorting

### Files to Create/Modify

#### 1. Create Lead Service (`client/src/services/leadService.ts`)

```typescript
-getLead(id) -
  getLeads(params) - // with filters
  createLead(data) -
  updateLead(id, data) -
  deleteLead(id) -
  convertLeadToCustomer(id, customerData);
```

#### 2. Update Leads Page (`client/src/pages/Leads.tsx`)

- Replace mock data with React Query
- Add search by name, email, phone
- Add filters: status, source, priority
- Add pagination
- Integrate CRUD modals

#### 3. Create Lead Modals

- `CreateLeadModal.tsx` - New lead form
- `EditLeadModal.tsx` - Edit existing lead
- `ConvertLeadModal.tsx` - Convert to customer

#### 4. Backend Enhancement (if needed)

- Lead conversion endpoint
- Lead analytics endpoint

## 🔄 Lead Lifecycle

```
┌─────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│   New   │ --> │ Contacted │ --> │ Qualified │ --> │ Converted │
└─────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘
     │                                                       │
     └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  (or Lost/Rejected)
```

### Status Flow

1. **New**: Just created, no contact yet
2. **Contacted**: Initial outreach made
3. **Qualified**: Meets criteria, interested
4. **Converted**: Became a customer
5. **Lost**: Not interested/rejected
6. **On Hold**: Waiting for customer response

Once Lead Management is complete, we'll integrate real analytics:

- Real customer/lead/deal counts
- Revenue metrics
- Conversion rates
- Charts with real data
- Date range filters
- Export functionality

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Lead Management will be considered complete when:

- ✅ All CRUD operations work end-to-end
- ✅ Search and filters function correctly
- ✅ Lead conversion creates customers successfully
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Loading and error states handled
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ Code committed to GitHub

---

## 💡 Technical Notes

### React Query Keys

```typescript
["leads"][("leads", id)][("leads", { status, source })]; // All leads // Single lead // Filtered leads
```

### API Endpoints (Already Available)

- `GET /api/leads` - List all leads
- `GET /api/leads/:id` - Get single lead
- `POST /api/leads` - Create lead
- `PUT /api/leads/:id` - Update lead
- `DELETE /api/leads/:id` - Delete lead

### State Management

- Use React Query for server state
- Local state for modals and forms
- AuthStore for authentication
